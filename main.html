    <h2> About the Founder </h2> 
    <p>
      Raised in a low-income household, Jordan Denmark knows firsthand the power of discipline, mentorship, and community support. Now a professional chemist and loving husband, the proud father of three has made it his mission to give back by creating opportunities he wishes he had growing up. That’s why he founded this free kids' wrestling camp — to offer a safe, encouraging space where kids can build confidence, develop life skills, and learn the value of hard work on and off the mat.
      
      This camp isn’t just about wrestling — it’s about empowering the next generation through structure, encouragement, and real community care. All skill levels are welcome, and every child is treated with respect, patience, and support.
      
      Registration is free — all we ask is that each child bring, at minimum, one canned good to donate. It’s a simple way to teach the value of giving back while helping local families in need.</p>
